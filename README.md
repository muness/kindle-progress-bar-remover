# Progress Bar remover for eInk Kindles

Last year, I decided to get an Kindle Keyboard 3G, and I loved it.  The eInk display was much clearer than my previous LCD devices, I could read outside and the battery life was amazing.  However, I was surprised that there was no way to disable the progress bar.  Not having a progress bar on every page was something I got used to on my previous eReader, a [NookColor running CyanogenMod](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=11452450&postcount=19).

From various articles I had read over the years, I had a vague notion that Kindles were Linux machines as well, and was therefore sure that there was a way to hack the progress bar away.  After some googling, I [found what I was looking for](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=142848).

It turned out that some geek had found a way to reduce the number of full page refreshes on the Kindle (like the [Nook did](http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/18/nook-gets-faster-page-turning-sync-across-devices-with-1-5-firmware-update-next-month/)).  Someone else [adapted that hack to hide the progress bar](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showpost.php?p=1674783&postcount=35).  The algorithm they used, in a nutshell:
* Watch for page turns
* If the Kindle is currently displaying a book, right out empty spaces over the area where the progress bar is displayed.

This does mean that if you look closely as you're flipping pages, you'll see the progress bar get drawn then hidden away.  Also, if you turn pages too quickly, the magic doesn't work.  

Despite these shortcomings, I was happy: I could continue to use my Kindle without suffering the annoying progress bar.  I wrapped the script with [launchpad](http://www.mobileread.com/forums/showthread.php?t=97636) so I could easily turn it on and off as I needed to.

The installation was far from straightfoward so I figured I'd document it.  While I was at it, I packaged up the hack and made a couple of minor tweaks.  Enjoy!
